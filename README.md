# Zipkin

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system used for monitoring and troubleshooting complex, distributed systems, especially microservices architectures. It helps developers understand how requests flow through different services, identify performance bottlenecks, and detect errors. Zipkin provides a visual representation of traces, allowing you to see the timing data for each service involved in a request. 

## Features of Java Microservices
- `Deployment`: It breaks an application into small services, because of this it is possible to deploy and develop each of these services independently.
- `Decentralization`: Data storage management is decentralized. Each of the services has its own data related to a particular business functionality.
- `Loosely Coupled`: If a single process fails, it will not affect the other services and the entire system.
- `Security`: It provides authentication and authorization based on the Role-based access model (RBAC).
- `Scalable`: Based on the requirements, services can be scaled which results in better scalability.
