# Zipkin

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system used for monitoring and troubleshooting complex, distributed systems, especially microservices architectures. It helps developers understand how requests flow through different services, identify performance bottlenecks, and detect errors. Zipkin provides a visual representation of traces, allowing you to see the timing data for each service involved in a request.
